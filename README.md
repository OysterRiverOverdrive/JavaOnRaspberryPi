# JavaOnRaspberryPi
Notes about how to setup and use a raspberry pi as a place to test Java code when a full robot/roborio is not available.

## Supplies

* Raspberry Pi (A [Raspberry Pi 3B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) was used for generating this tutorial).
* A micro SD card.
* A micro SD card adapter (if your computer doesn't have a non-micro SD card slot). 
* Micro USB power supply. This can be just a standard micro SD cable plugged into a USB port.
* Monitor with HDMI (most raspberry pis have an HDMI output but check to be sure).
* USB keyboard and mouse.

## Installing the Operating System

Installing an operating sysetem (OS) onto an SD card is also known as "flashing" the SD card. What's happening here is that we're downloding a copy of the files and folders/directories that should be written to the disk (referred to as a "disk image"), and overwriting whatever may have existed on the disk/card before with the new files.

Below are two installation options:

* General Installation - Use this one if you're not sure.
* Linux CLI-based Installation - For advanced users.

### General Installation

The Raspberry Pi website has up to date documentation on how to install the OS from a variety of computers.  Follow the directions in https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/ to install the OS.

### Linux CLI-based Installation
